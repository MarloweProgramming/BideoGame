current hierarchy for entity design

to package these is:
package model.Objects.entities
substitute in folder names

should Bosses be a passive or Aggressive entity. 
logic would be that passive only attacks when attacked while aggressive will attack once close enough to player


Objects
    entities
        a Passive
        b Aggressive
        c Friendly
    items
        a
        b
        c
