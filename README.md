# BideoGame  
Ryan and Alex's summer 2022 video game repository  


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rukn6J4Q9x9d68HGiGSNuxZrF8JBUF9vnxGbK7S6G2w/edit?usp=sharing  

current hierarchy for entity design  

to package these is:  

package model.entities  
substitute in folder names  

should Bosses be a passive or Aggressive entity?  
logic would be that passive only attacks when attacked while aggressive will attack once close enough to player  

class files start with capital letters: EG Entity.java  
folders/directories start with lowercase letters: EG passiveEntities
